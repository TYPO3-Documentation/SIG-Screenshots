Changed for puppeteer implementation
====================================

-  Added config to ``.ddev/config.yaml``

   -  Added packages, puppeteer needs to run headless chrome
   -  Added post-start hook that installs basic TYPO3 with user:
      ``admin`` with password ``typo3.demo``
   -  Added post-start hook to create puppeteer admin user:
      ``pptr_admin`` with same password

-  Added ddev command ``puppeteer [filename]``
-  Added ``package.json`` with dependency to puppeteer
-  Added folder ``Screenshots`` to save created Images
-  Added ``puppeteer-testscript.js`` which will collect some screenshots
   from the running DDEV instance

Todo to set up puppeteer
========================

After running ``dev start``

   DDEV creates Puppeteer users

So far so good, but when running ``ddev restart`` to start over and the
users already exists, there will be an exitcode 1

::

   Open Question: How to prevent exitcode 1, on already existing users?
